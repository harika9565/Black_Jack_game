# The code represents a simplified version of a card game where the player competes against the computer (dealer). Here's a brief explanation:
## The player is prompted to choose whether to play or exit.
## If the player decides to play, two random cards are dealt to both the player and the computer from an unlimited deck of cards.
## The player's cards and their total value are displayed, along with the computer's first card.
## The player can choose to draw additional cards ("y") or stop drawing ("n").
## The game follows standard rules where face cards (Jack, Queen, King) count as 10 and the Ace can count as either 11 or 1.
## After the player's turn, the computer reveals its second card and continues drawing until its total value exceeds the player's or reaches 21.

Note: The game does not remove cards from the deck, and the deck consists of the following cards: [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]. The outcome is determined by comparing the total values of the player and the computer, following the rules of the game.
